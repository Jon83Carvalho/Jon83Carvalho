### Focused on data understanding and exploration ðŸ¤“!!



These are my interest and developments I am working on!

## DataAndArt
- I am developing a homepage for data with art in https://github.com/Jon83Carvalho/DataAndArt, hosted in http://datandart.com
I use a server in AWS service.

## Commodities price database
- I did a project where it collects data about commodities price and creates a database to be accessed and also install a Dashboard in https://github.com/Jon83Carvalho/Projeto-edc-JonasCarvalho-igti

#### The architecture of the solution is as described below
