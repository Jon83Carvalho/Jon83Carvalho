### Focused on data understanding and exploration ðŸ¤“!!



These are my interest and developments I am working on!

## DataAndArt
- I am developing a homepage for data with art in https://github.com/Jon83Carvalho/datahomenew, hosted in http://www.datandart.com
I used a server in AWS service, but then transitionated to an on premisses solution with a simples server using Raspberry Pi.

Recently I developed a a view of digital coins in real time to understand the volume of negotiations. The view shows the top ten negotiated coins in the period the reading started and the volume at each recent price for the top 5 most negotiated coins. This may assist on understanding trendings in coin negotiations.

## Commodities price database
- I did a project where it collects data about commodities price and creates a database to be accessed and also install a Dashboard in https://github.com/Jon83Carvalho/Projeto-edc-JonasCarvalho-igti

#### The architecture of the solution is as described below

#### Final data is stored in AWS Athena

## Non-Newtonian flow
- I collaborated with NIST in developing an example about Non-Newtonian fluid flow using fipy in https://github.com/usnistgov/fipy/tree/master/examples/flow

I am an enthusiast of data and engineering! LetÂ´s explore it!
